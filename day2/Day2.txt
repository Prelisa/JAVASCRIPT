New keyword is used in any programming langugage which is used to call constructor

 JS is loosely typed programming langugage


Non Primitive datatype
 Non-primitive datatype stores the heterogenous data.
 Array and object are non primitive datatype
 Array is stored using [] notation
 object is the collection of key and value pair
Example:
var b= new Array() // This is called the constructor syntax
New is used to create the new instance and calls constructor

With array comes index, we need to work with value, starts with 0

Object (collection of key value pair)

var ram= {
    name: 'ram',
    address: 'tinkune',
    phone: 22333,
    presentStatus: false,
    class: 3
}
ram.class=4; // replacing class value
we can also add new value with this Example is given below
ram.house='red' // this new property will be added



1. Dot notation >> ram.class=4; 
if there is no value or the property of the object because it is undefined.
example: ram.helicopter (this is undefined)
because ram exist which has the memory but no value so undefined

2. Bracket Notation >> 
example: ram['phone']
the value can be accessed with the string notation inside the Bracket
if we do lets say ram[phone] this will get a reference error

reference error is a error generated when we try to use non allocated memory.
memory nai allocate vako chaina but you are trying to use it this is called as reference error
YOu should understand that is never initialized if there is reference error


taking one example:

var ram= {
    name: 'ram',
    address: 'tinkune',
    phone: 22333,
    presentStatus: false,
    class: 3
} 
if we don't give string notation then reference error occurs.

But if we do this like

var phone='name';
console.log('ram>>'+ram[phone]);

this phone takes the reference of ram.name and shows the value of ram,name as it is referred by the word phone
so the output is ram.


Bracket notation is recommended while working with references.
